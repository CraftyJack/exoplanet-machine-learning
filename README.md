# exoplanet machine learning

For this exercise we use two different ML models (logistic regression and SVC) on Kepler exoplanet data. Both models were tuned using GridSearchCV.

Logistic regression proved to be the more accurate of the two models, but only by a small margin (0.898 test accuracy for logistic regression vs. 0.881 for SVC when tested for prediction accuracy on test data). Given the relatively small difference in accuracy, both models have been saved.
